        <h2>It's a me, Mario</h2>
        <p>
            My past might be ugly, but I am still beautiful.
            I have made mistakes, but I will not let them define me.
            My soul radiates from the inside and warms the souls of others.
            I do not compare myself to others. The only person I compare myself to is the person I was yesterday. And as long as the person I am today is even the tiniest bit better than the person I was yesterday—I am meeting my own definition of success.
            Note to self: I am going to make you so proud.
            I accept myself for who I am and create peace, power and confidence of mind and of heart.
            I am going to forgive myself and free myself. I deserve to forgive and be forgiven.
            I am healing and strengthening every day.
            I have made it through hard times before, and I have come out stronger and better because of them. I am going to make it through this.

    <h2>Join Today!</h2>
    <p>
        I do not waste away a single day of my life. I squeeze every ounce of value out of each of my days on this planet—today, tomorrow, and everyday.
        I must remember the incredible power I possess within me to achieve anything I desire.
