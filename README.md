The Net Ninja HTML &amp; CSS Tutorial Project 2

While learning HTML and CSS I camp across the The Net Ninja tutorials on HTML & CSS which he posted on his YouTube Channel.

The other tutorial was [HTML & CSS Crash Course Tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ivBf_eKCPIAYXWzLlPAm6G). At the end I built Mario Webpage.

Deployed on netlify, check it [here]()
